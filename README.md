## Problem Statement
A retail company “ABC Ltd” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour against various products of different categories, age, gender and city. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.

## Customer Data Analysis of Black Friday Sale
I performed an exploratory data analysis on Black Friday dataset which I found on Kaggle. Starting with dealing with outliers, then handling the missing values and finally plotting it in order to find the trend. The goal of this analysis was to get an overview of customer behaviour and visually present it in front of marketing team.
